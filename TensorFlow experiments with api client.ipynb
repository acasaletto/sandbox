Setup\n\nBefore you use the sample code in this notebook, you must perform the following setup tasks:\n\n-  Create a [Watson Machine Learning Service](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/ibm-watson-machine-learning/) instance (a lite plan is offered). \n-  Create [Cloud Object Storage (COS)](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/infrastructure/cloud-object-storage) instance (a lite plan is offered).\n    - After you create COS instance, go to your COS dashboard.\n    - In \"Service credentials\" tab, click on \"New Credential\",\n    - Add inline configuration parameter: {\"HMAC\":true}, click \"Add\".\n\n    This configuration parameter will add section below to instance credentials which will be used later on,\n    ```\n      \"cos_hmac_keys\": {\n            \"access_key_id\": \"722432c254bc4eaa96e05897bf2779e2\",\n            \"secret_access_key\": \"286965ac10ecd4de8b44306288c7f5a3e3cf81976a03075c\"\n       }\n    ```",
